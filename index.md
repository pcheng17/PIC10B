## Discussion Code

I will be using this page to post all of my code from discussion so that no one needs to go through the extra authentication step just to log into CCLE. It's quite annoying...

I presented some examples of why `new` and `delete` are important to know. We also talked about different pointer types. I included the example that I wanted to use to talk about function pointers, but I didn't actually get around to it. In order to compile this code to see the output of the final example, you need to comment out almost everything else in `int main()`.

We spent the entire discussion talking about `new` and `delete`, which also involves a discussion of the stack and heap. I added a ton of comments that summarize what we actually talked about.

Practice with pointers. We talked about what pointers are, and looked at some examples of how they're used.

A review of classes from PIC 10A. I also demonstrate the commenting style for functions that Professor Falcon requires.
