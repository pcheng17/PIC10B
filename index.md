## Discussion Code

I will be using this page to post all of my code from discussion so that no one needs to go through the extra authentication step just to log into CCLE.

#### Week 3, Thursday (4/19)
<a href="Code/readFile.txt" download>readFile.txt</a><br>
File we'll be using in discussion to learn about streams.

#### Week 3, Tuesday (4/17)
<a href="Code/DisWeek3_1.cpp" download>DisWeek3_1.cpp</a>, <a href="Code/integers.txt" download>integers.txt</a><br>
We officially talked about `typedef` and function pointers. Then, we briefly saw a quick introduction to file streams. We'll see way more on Thursday. I've also posted integers.txt, the text file that we practiced reading in from. For Mac users, this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23438393/new-to-xcode-cant-open-files-in-c) will be really helpful in getting your projects setup to open files with `std::ifstream` and `std::ofstream` objects. 

#### Week 2, Thursday (4/12)
<a href="Code/DisWeek2_2.cpp" download>DisWeek2_2.cpp</a><br>
I presented some examples of why `new` and `delete` are important to know. We also talked about different pointer types. I included the example that I wanted to use to talk about function pointers, but I didn't actually get around to it. In order to compile this code to see the output of the final example, you need to comment out almost everything else in `int main()`.

#### Week 2, Tuesday (4/10)
<a href="Code/DisWeek2_1.cpp" download>DisWeek2_1.cpp</a><br>
We spent the entire discussion talking about `new` and `delete`, which also involves a discussion of the stack and heap. I added a ton of comments that summarize what we actually talked about. 

#### Week 1, Thursday (4/5)
<a href="Code/DisWeek1_2.cpp" download>DisWeek1_2.cpp</a><br>
Practice with pointers. We talked about what pointers are, and looked at some examples of how they're used. 

#### Week 1, Tuesday (4/3)
<a href="Code/DisWeek1_1.cpp" download>DisWeek1_1.cpp</a><br>
A review of classes from PIC 10A. I also demonstrate the commenting style for functions that Professor Falcon requires.
